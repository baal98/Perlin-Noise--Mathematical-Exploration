    "13. $N(x)$: Perlin noise value at position $x$ before normalization.\n",

    "2. **Building Blocks**: 1D Perlin noise serves as a foundation for higher-dimensional Perlin noise, such as 2D and 3D. The core principles, such as interpolation and smoothstep, remain the same across dimensions, but the implementation becomes more complex as dimensions increase. By first understanding the 1D case, we will have a clearer understanding of how these building blocks are used in more complex scenarios.\n",

    "3. **Visualization**: Visualizing and interpreting 1D Perlin noise is more accessible due to its linear nature, making it easier to see how the noise is generated and how the interpolation and smoothstep functions work to create a continuous, non-repeating pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Applications**: While 2D and 3D Perlin noise have more widespread use in computer graphics, 1D Perlin noise still has applications in various fields, such as audio synthesis, procedural generation of one-dimensional content (e.g., terrain height profiles), and as a component in more complex algorithms.\n",
