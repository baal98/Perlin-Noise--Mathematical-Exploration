    "\n",
    "   - ***`Perlin Noise Generation`***\n",
    "The noise is generated by iterating through every pixel in an image of the defined size, at each pixel applying the Perlin noise function, which takes the coordinates of the pixel (scaled by a frequency parameter) as input. The output is a continuous value between -1 and 1. The frequency of the Perlin noise defines how rapidly the values change and is adjustable by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - ***`Normalization and Flattening`***\n",
    "The 2D Perlin noise is then normalized to a range between -1 and 1 and flattened into a 1D array. Normalization ensures that the values of the Perlin noise do not exceed the dynamic range of the audio data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - ***`Audio Conversion`***\n",
    "The normalized, flattened Perlin noise array is then converted to 16-bit PCM WAV audio data, with the amplitude being adjustable with the slider. The amplitude defines how loud the final audio will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - ***`Displaying`***\n",
    "The Perlin noise and its frequency spectrum are then displayed side by side. The Perlin noise is displayed as a grayscale image, and the frequency spectrum is displayed as a line graph, with the x-axis representing frequency and the y-axis representing amplitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`Interactive Widgets`**\n",
    "Finally, interactive widgets are created allow us to adjust the parameters of the Perlin noise (number of octaves, amplitude, and frequency).\n",
    "\n",
    "The noise is visualized as an image, which looks like a marble pattern or a cloudy texture depending on the frequency and octaves parameters. The frequency spectrum shows the intensity of the noise at each frequency, with red dashed lines indicating the fundamental frequency and its harmonics for each octave of the noise.\n",

    "### **`Perlin noise and its effect on audio`**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's often applied in graphics programming to produce natural-looking phenomena, but it can also be applied to audio to create various types of random, yet smooth sounds, mimicking natural sounds such as wind, water, or other environmental noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***`Octaves:`*** The 'octaves' parameter impacts the complexity of the noise, with higher values resulting in more intricate and detailed noise. More octaves mean more detail is added to the basic noise, contributing to the \"roughness\" or \"smoothness\" of the resulting sound. Each additional octave adds a layer of detail, creating a rich, complex sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***`Amplitude:`*** The 'amplitude' parameter controls the loudness of the noise. In the context of this code, it directly affects the maximum volume of the generated sound. Higher amplitude values will create louder sounds, while lower values will produce quieter sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***`Frequency`:*** The 'frequency' parameter affects the rate of change or \"pitch\" of the noise. In the context of the code, it modifies how rapidly the noise values change over space. A higher frequency means the noise will change more quickly, leading to a \"rougher\" or \"coarser\" sound, while a lower frequency creates a more gradual, \"smoother\" sound. In the Perlin noise image, higher frequency values will produce more variation within a given space, leading to more detailed noise.\n",
